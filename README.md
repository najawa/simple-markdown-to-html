# Simple Markdown to HTML
## Implementation of Markdown-It (https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)

### Introduction

This was a quick implementation of Markdown-It for hosting quick markdown notes as simple HTML. It automatically turns non-link syntax into hyperlinks, so I can use markdown as a pseudo-note-taking syntax as quickly as possible. Use/fork/contort to your own needs, I claim no rights to any of this. Please confirm with markdown-its licenses before doing anything legally creative with it.

### Usage

Simply add an input.md in the same directory as this HTML file, and it will render via javascript.

### Donations

I'm just kidding, have fun!
